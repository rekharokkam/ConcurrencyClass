A Deamon thread is a worker thread. Only deamon threads cannot keep an application alive. If there are only deamon threads then an application would die. 
User threads by contrast can keep an application alive. An application stays alive as long as there is at least one User thread that's active.

main thread exists when it leaves main method meaning once main method ends/completes main thread exits. Once a thread dies it cannot be restarted. Its dead for good.

When a Thread is created it gets its own stack scratchpad (temporary storage) for storage at the system level. It gets 4 Kb of storage to use for parameters and local variables.

A thread created by User Thread is a User thread. A thread created by Deamon thread is a deamon thread.
