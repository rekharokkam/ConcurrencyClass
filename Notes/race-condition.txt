Happens when there are more than 1 thread in the same process.
Happens for a shared resource in the memory. Since both the threads have access to the same memory of the processor race condition happens.
For race condition to happen there should at least be 1 write operation meaning at least one thread should perform the write operation amongst other threads.
Threads inside the same processor have access to the same memory location.

Synchronization needs to happen on the same lock Object.
Synchronization is across processors. Ex - there are 2 processors each with 2 threads in that case synchronization is between all 4 threads of 2 different processors.
